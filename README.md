# "War and Peace", by Leo Tolstoy
I took the text from the work from the library [lib.ru](http://http://az.lib.ru/t/tolstoj_lew_nikolaewich/text_0073.shtml "lib.ru") and carried out the initial processing. The goal was to process the words from this work. I broke the text into individual words and output each one on a separate line. Additionally, in places where chapters begin, I added a line indicating the new chapter.
